# AlarmClock_r2v6

Somewhere in early 2019 began a journey that one might call life changing for me: In my 11th school term did my computer science teacher give us a simple Arduino to learn the basics of programming. I soon was hooked deeply into the fields of micocrontroller and set myself a, as I thought at that time, simple goal: **To build myself an Alarm Clock using a microcontroller.**

Having not the faintest clue about just how complex such a project would be for someone who just started to learn programming did I jump head first into this long adventure. Not knowing anything about project managing, version control or anything else besides how to write code in the Arduino IDE did I soon encountered many difficulties, making many "version" where I completely restarted the project from scratch. Somewhere in early 2020 had I achieved the unbelievable: **I had built myself a quite simple Alarm Clock using an Arduino UNO.**

I, however, was not happy and satisfied with the result. Wanting to have more and better features did I started to designing a revision: **Alarm Clock r2**. Being stupid and not knowing what I was doing did I called it the second revision, because I already had a minor "version" system and it was the second major version. Having gained some knowledge during the development of the first project did I actually plan the concept of the "second" revision. My version system however stayed the same. 

After some time between development and many minor versions or restarts had I now, early 2023, arrived at this point: **Alarm Clock r2 v6** - this time wanting to do things right. I was currently in my fourth tearm of my studies in Media Computer Science at the Harz University of Applied Science and had learned the fundamental basics needed to develop project of the scope like this; version control systems, how to write good code, quality control, ... I was confident that this might be the finish line of my journy of building a "simple" Alarm Clock.

But if I will actually reach this goal, well, I hope to find out soon...

(This will someday be updated with proper information about the two AlarmClocks and more details about the journey... I hope)
